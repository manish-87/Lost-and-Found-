Facial Detection: Employ OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier or Dlib HOG + Linear SVM detector for face detection.
Feature Extraction: Experiment with classic OpenCV feature descriptors like HOG or LBP.
Explore extracting embeddings using pre-trained deep learning models (FaceNet, ArcFace, etc.).
Similarity Matching: Calculate Euclidean distance or cosine similarity between feature vectors to find potential matches.
Database Storage s Search: Design a database schema to efficiently store images, extracted features, and associated metadata.
